				<h3>General Description</h3>
				<p>
					Designed for students beginning to learn grammar and elementary 
					arithmetic including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
					division as well as an additional category of prime numbers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The grammar portion of the game includes three category choices
					that students can select which are nouns, verbs, or adjectives. 
				</p>
				<p>
                    Students have the option of choosing from three difficulty 
                    levels for both game types which are easy, intermediate, 
                    and hard.  Game variables can also be switched to alter how the 
                    game is played such as player speed as well as the number
                    of possible answers.

				<h3>Game Details</h3>
				<p>
					For math based problems, the number range will vary for each problem 
					type depending upon the difficulty level chosen.  The following list 
					provides the problem type followed by the number range for easy, intermediate, 
					nd hard difficulty:
					<ul>
						<li>Addition (0-6, 0-9, 0-12)</li>
						<li>Subtraction (0-6, 0-12, 0-20)</li>
						<li>Multiplication (0-6, 0-9, 0-12)</li>
						<li>Division (0-10, 0-30, 0-60)</li>
						<li>Prime Numbers (0-7, 0-19, 0-31)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

					For grammar based problems, the harder the difficulty selected,
		            the greater the number of syllables for the part of speech.  The following 
		            list provides the part of speech followed by examples for easy, intermediate, 
		            and hard difficulty.
